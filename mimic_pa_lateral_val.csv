The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear unchanged since at least

 difficult to compare directly to the recent prior CT although the distribution
 of the background interstitial abnormality appears fairly similar.

 etiology such as mild vascular congestion or atypical infection could explain
 the change, since the distribution is very similar, worsening of a underlying
 interstitial disease is probably the most likely reason.

 well with adjacent parenchymal opacities that most likely reflect atelectasis;
 however, concurrent infection cannot be excluded in the appropriate situation.

 edema.  Median sternotomy wires and aortic valve replacement as well as
 mediastinal clips are overall unchanged.  No pneumothorax.  The heart is
 stably enlarged, although difficult to fully assess in the setting of the left

PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding

 thoracic aorta is generally widened and elongated and shows calcium deposits
 in the wall, mostly at the level of the arch.  Pulmonary vasculature
 demonstrates an upper zone re-distribution pattern; however, there is no
 evidence of acute interstitial or alveolar edema.  Also, the lateral and
 posterior pleural sinuses are free from any fluid accumulation and no evidence
 of pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  A thin plate atelectasis in the

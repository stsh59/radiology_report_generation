On the frontal view, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is similar to the prior
 study. The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is calcified and unfolded. Mild
 prominence of the right hilum, with a tapered appearance, raises the question
 of pulmonary hypertension, unchanged.
 
 Of note, on the lateral view, the AP diameter of the descending aorta appears
 larger than on the prior study, measuring approximately 4.0 cm on today's exam
 versus 3.6 cm on the ___ exam, at the level of the mid thoracic spine.
 
 No CHF, focal infiltrate, or effusion is identified. No pneumothorax is
 detected. A vague patchy density measuring ___.0 mm is seen in the right upper
 chest laterally, overlying the inferior right third rib, not visualized on the
 prior exam.
 
 Again seen is eventration of the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 Multiple surgical clips noted in the region of the GE junction and midline
 upper abdomen.  By report, the patient is status post prior Billroth surgery.
IMPRESSION:
1) No acute pulmonary process identified.  In particular, no focal infiltrate
 suggestive of pneumonia.
 
 2) Apparent increase in AP diameter of the descending aorta.  While it is
 possible that this appearance could be artifactual due to differences in
 degree of magnification for the patient rotation, it cannot be readily
 dismissed in this way on these images given the relative diameter compared to
 the size of the vertebral bodies.  Is there clinical evidence concerning for
 thoracic dissection?
 
 3) 14 mm patchy opacity in the right mid zone laterally, new compared with the
 prior study.  This appearance is more suggestive of a pleural plaque or an
 artifact due to overlying structures, than a focal infiltrate.
 
 RECOMMENDATION(S):  1) Clinical correlation requested regarding apparent
 interval increase in AP diameter of the descending thoracic aorta.  Is there
 clinical evidence concerning for thoracic dissection?  No change in the
 appearance of the aorta on the frontal view is identified.  This finding was
 discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ at the time of discovery at
 approximately 15:10 pm on ___.
 
 2) Focal nodular opacity in the right mid zone laterally new compared with ___, of uncertain etiology or significance.  If clinically indicated, oblique
 radiograph of the chest could help for further assessment.  Alternatively,
 recommend attention to this area on followup radiographic examination in ___
 weeks.",2436

A Port-A-Cath terminates in the superior vena cava.  The cardiac, mediastinal

 small pleural effusions, greater on the left than right, not significantly

 increased but probably due to atelectasis.

Mild increase in left posterior basilar opacity, probably compatible with
 atelectasis, associated with a pleural effusion although infectious etiology
 is not excluded by this examination.  Stable small pleural effusions.",597
